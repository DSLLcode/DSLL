# Deep Streaming Label Learning (DSLL)

- Exploring and exploiting the knowledge from past labels and historical models to understand and develop emerging new labels.

- Framework: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

 
## Dependence

- python 3.7
- Pytoch 1.4
- liac-arff (pip install liac-arff)

## Running
`cd ./`    # Open the folder where the code is located

`python3 DSLL.py`

## Results

**Table 1.** Ranking performance of each comparison algorithm for learning new labels with different batch sizes by regarding 50\% of labels as past labels. \#label denotes the number of new labels. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\downarrow(\uparrow)) 
means the smaller (larger) the value, the better the performance.
